Teaching experience and activities 

 
I have taught the following courses in the Department of Applied Mathematics (from 1995, Mathematics & 
Applied Mathematics) at UCT: partial differential equations, classical mechanics, calculus of several 
variables (2nd year), complex variables, tensor analysis, applied functional analysis, methods of 
mathematical physics (3rd year), continuum Mechanics, numerical analysis and scientific computing, 
methods of mathematical physics, finite elements (3rd and 4th years), Honours projects on topics in 
continuum mechanics, variational methods, and finite element analysis 
 
I have taught courses at Masters level, at Cerecam, on finite element analysis, continuum mechanics, 
and on nonlinear material behaviour. 
 
Examining and reviewing activities 
 
These include the following:  
 
External examiner for courses in applied mathematics and engineering at a number of South African 
universities, and as examiner for masters and doctoral dissertations submitted to universities in South 
Africa, Germany and France. 
 

4 

 

 

 

External panel member on reviews of departments or schools of mathematical sciences at the 
Universities of the Free State, Pretoria, the Witwatersrand, and Zululand, and of the faculty of science, 
University of Johannesburg  
 
Member of the review team for the statutory 2009 institutional review of the University of Johannesburg. 
 
Panel member for review of project proposals, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (Germany) 
 

Research interests 

 
My research interests lie at the intersection of continuum mechanics, applied functional analysis, 
and numerical analysis and computing. My research programmes address some or all of the 
following issues: the formulation in mathematical terms of problems in continuum mechanics; 
studies of the well-posedness of such problems; construction by computational means of 
approximate solutions; and studies of the quality of such approximations. I also have a serious 
involvement in finite element analysis per se. Recent major interests have been in the areas of 
plasticity, biomechanics, and mixed finite element methods.
